Adds bibliographic metadata in as many formats as possible to posts. 

== Description ==

This plugin enables other software to extract who, what and when information
from a blog and it's posts. It is part of the Knowledgeblog project
(http://knowledgeblog.org).

It is often useful to embed bibliographic metadata, describing the author(s),
title and publication date into a web page. There are a variety of different
ways of doing this, described in a variety of different specifications and/or
standards. These vary widely in their formality, uptake and age, as well as
clarity with which the specification is written. 

The practical upshot of this is that automatic capture of metadata which
enables tools such as Greycite (http://greycite.knowledgeblog.org) and various
bibliographic software to work is a somewhat ad hoc affair. Sometimes it
works, sometimes it does not. Rather than requiring users to add a separate
plugin for each of these specifications, kblog-metadata takes the approach of
adding metadata in as many formats as possible, in the hope that, for any
tool, at least one will work. 

Currently supported standards include:
1. COinS (http://ocoins.info).
1. Meta tags as suggested by Google Scholar. 

We will include new formats or specifications where possible, so long as they
are not too computationally intensive. Please send email to the group above if
you want a new format. 

== Installation ==
