<p>Tools for exposing and editing the bibliographic metadata of academic posts. </p>

<p>== Description ==</p>

<p>This plugin enables other software to extract who, what and when information
from a blog and it's posts. It is part of the Knowledgeblog project
(http://knowledgeblog.org), which is developing plugins to improve WordPress
as a tool for academic publishing, either for individual authors, or for
conferences and workshops publishing proceedings to the web. </p>

<p>It is often useful to embed bibliographic metadata, describing the author(s),
title and publication date into a web page. There are a variety of different
ways of doing this, described in a variety of different specifications and/or
standards. These vary widely in their formality, uptake and age, as well as
clarity with which the specification is written. </p>

<p>The practical upshot of this is that automatic capture of metadata which
enables tools such as Greycite (http://greycite.knowledgeblog.org) and various
bibliographic software to work is a somewhat ad hoc affair. Sometimes it
works, sometimes it does not. Rather than requiring users to add a separate
plugin for each of these specifications, kblog-metadata takes the approach of
adding metadata in as many formats as possible, in the hope that, for any
tool, at least one will work. </p>

<p>Kblog Metadata enhances the ability of WordPress to expose and edit
bibliographic metadata of academic posts. It currently consists of three core
pieces of functionality</p>

<ul>
<li>kblog-headers -- adds invisible metadata</li>
<li>kblog-authors -- allows multiple authors, without requring WordPress accounts</li>
<li>kblog-table-of-contents -- displays all posts in a variety of formats. </li>
</ul>

<p>We will include new formats or specifications where possible, so long as they
are not too computationally intensive. Please send email to the <a href="mailto:knowledgeblog@googlegroups.com">mailing
list</a> if you are interested in a new format.</p>

<p>== Kblog Headers ==</p>

<p>There are many tools to which academics may want to advertise their work. We
currently support three independent standards which are:</p>

<ol>
<li>COinS (http://ocoins.info).</li>
<li>Meta tags as suggested by Google Scholar.</li>
<li>Open Graph Protocol (http://ogp.me) </li>
</ol>

<p>These will be automatically added to add pages and posts on installation of
the plugin. The metadata is taken either from the user profile, the WordPress
metadata, or from Kblog Author metadata. </p>

<p>== Kblog Table of Contents == </p>

<p>The table of contents functionality comes in two forms: one designed for
embedding in an existing page, and one for computational consumption. To add a
table of contents to a page add a "shortcode" to your post contents. </p>

<p>&#91;kblogtoc&#93;</p>

<p>Additionally, it is also possible to retrieve a simple HTML or plain text
representation of the table of contents from (http://blogurl/?kblog-toc=txt)
or (http://blogurl/?kblog-toc=html). Author information comes from 
Kblog Author.</p>

<p>== Kblog Authors ==</p>

<p>Academic writing is more often multi-author than not, yet this is poorly
supported within WordPress. While there are existing co-author plugins these
often require assigning multiple user accounts, one per author, even though
many authors will never login to WordPress. Within Kblog Authors you can add
"display authors", totally independently from WordPress accounts. They will
appear on Kblog Table of Contents and in metadata generated by Kblog Headers. </p>

<p>== Installation ==</p>

<ol>
<li>Unzip the downloaded .zip archive to the <code>/wp-content/plugins/</code> directory</li>
<li>Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress</li>
</ol>
